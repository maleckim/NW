Project can be installed and ran via 'npm i' then execute the start script 'npm run start'

Project is a very simple single page with search and display functionality built with React and uses redux/toolkit for state management.
I did not have an oppurtunity to test thoroughly but it seems to accept phrases as well as single words for searching through the API's gallery.

The api consumed is The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API and links to its documents can be found here. https://metmuseum.github.io/
